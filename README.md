🫀 Heart Disease Dashboard – Power BI Project
This project is a data visualization and analysis report built using Microsoft Power BI, focusing on heart disease patient data. The dashboard provides insights into patient survival, age distribution, and health-related risk factors. It's designed to help users explore trends, identify patterns, and understand how various conditions like smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and anaemia impact heart disease outcomes.

📊 What the Dashboard Shows
✅ Survival Rate: Percentage of patients who survived (67.62%)

📅 Average Age of Survival: 58.63 years

💀 Total Death Events vs Survivals: Comparative metrics

📉 Death Event Trends by Age Group

❤️ Ejection Fraction and Serum Creatinine Levels

⚠️ Health Risk Factors by Age Group (smoking, diabetes, etc.)

👩‍⚕️ Gender-based filtering and age group comparisons

🎯 Purpose
This dashboard was created to:

Practice data storytelling using Power BI

Analyze medical data in a visually engaging way

Provide quick insights for decision-makers or researchers

Showcase skills in Power Query, DAX, and dashboard design

🛠 Tools Used

🧠 Insights Gained
Survival rates decrease significantly with age

Higher death rates observed in age groups 61–70 and 51–60

Risk factors like diabetes and high blood pressure are more prevalent in mid-to-older age groups

Males have slightly different survival patterns compared to females
